If implemented, EIP-1559 could greatly reduce transaction costs and improve Ethereum's overall user experience.

- How will EIP-1559 impact Ethereum's price? From a fundamental perspective, the biggest impact of EIP-1559 is the shift to burning transaction fees rather than sending them to miners who generally sell them to cover their costs, creating a constant stream of ETH selling pressure.

- Note: EIP-1559 does not bring changes to the Gas Limit , the maximum amount of gas the transaction is authorized to consume.
